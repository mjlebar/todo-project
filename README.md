# todo-project
To-do-list website
Developed through The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) - this was a chance to 
use more sophisticated JavaScript practices. The project is constructed using modules, with webpack combining everything together.
It took me some work to figure out how to use webpack with GitHub, but it was worth the work!
